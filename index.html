		<p> Sophomore <b> International Studies </b> Major </p>
		
		
		
	
	<p style="background-color:#b3d9FF"> I am a student at <a
	 href=
	 "http://http://www.bju.edu/">
	 Bob Jones University</a>. My major is a combination of <b> International Business </b>
	and <b> International Relations</b>. </p>
	
	<p> I am from Levittown, Pennsylvania. I am very interested in globalization, foreign cultures, and languages.
	I am currently learning three: <b>Spanish</b>,<b> Korean</b>, and <b> Russian</b>. I believe that all cultures have something to teach
	and something to learn from one another, and that<b> the Gospel of Jesus Christ</b> is the most powerful unifier of 
	cultures that exists. </p> 
	
	<p> In my spare time I enjoy studying the languages I am learning, watching foreign dramas, and listening
	to music in various languages. </p>
